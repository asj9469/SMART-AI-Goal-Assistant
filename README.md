## Background:
- A project submitted to the PromptHacks 2023 Hackathon
- Inspired by my Intro to IT and Informatics course, where I learned about project management and effective goal setting methods
- As an individual who loves to help others, I thought this hackathon would be a good opportunity for me to try create a tool to help people set more efficient goals.
- Especially with an AI chatbot, I could interact more with the user on a conversational level, so I thought it would be great to guide them through long-term goal planning.

## What does this AI assistant do?
- help users to specify their long term goals and create an efficient plan to achieve them
- brings together the main emphases of two famous goal setting methods, OKR and SMART
- guides the user to think about the ultimate goal they want to achieve
- encourage user to think of a reasonable timeline for the goal
- makes the user set a method of measurement in regards to their progress
